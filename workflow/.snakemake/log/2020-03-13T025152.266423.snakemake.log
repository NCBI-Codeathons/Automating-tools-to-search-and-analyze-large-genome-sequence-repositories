Error in rule hisat2_align:
    jobid: 23
    output: data/mappedreads/counts.bam
    shell:
        hisat2 -x data/indexfiles/sra --sra-acc counts| samtools view -Sb -F4 - | samtools sort - > data/mappedreads/counts.bam
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job hisat2_align since they might be corrupted:
data/mappedreads/counts.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
